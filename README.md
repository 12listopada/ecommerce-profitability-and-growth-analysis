# E-commerce Profitability and Growth Analysis

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end data analysis of an online retail business, focusing on sales performance, profitability, customer behavior, and growth trends.  
The goal is to transform raw transactional data into actionable business insights that support data-driven decision-making.

The analysis follows a structured analytical workflow, from defining the business context and cleaning data to KPI analysis, segmentation, and business recommendations.

## Business Context

The company is a UK-based online retail business operating without physical stores.  
It sells products online to customers across multiple countries and relies on transactional sales data to evaluate performance.

As the business grows, stakeholders want to better understand:
- Whether revenue is growing over time
- Whether revenue growth is profitable
- Which products and markets contribute most to performance
- How customer behavior differs between new and returning customers
- Whether there are observable trends or seasonal patterns in sales

---

## Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this analysis are to:

- Evaluate overall sales performance and profitability
- Identify key growth drivers and underperforming segments
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior
- Detect trends and seasonality in revenue
- Provide data-driven business recommendations

## Dataset

The analysis is based on the **Online Retail Dataset**, which contains transactional data from a UK-based e-commerce company.

The dataset includes:
- Invoice-level transaction data
- Product information
- Customer identifiers
- Transaction dates and prices
- Geographic information (country)

The original dataset does not contain cost information.  
To enable profitability (P&L) analysis, product costs are modeled as part of the analytical process.
